Copyright claim: Hotdog Sprite Used for Menus

	The hotdog sprite used within the menus is a simple hotdog picture. After downloading and using the design for my menus, I did a reverse image search to find that the image comes from "Zazzle", an online merchandise site. 
	The design falls under copyright as it is an original artistic design by the author. This use violates copyright as I do not give credit, and I did not get the author/owner permission. 
	I can argue that I can use this under fair use as I am not using the image entirely, as the original design has a quote above it, so I am using only a part of the design, it doesn't affect the market of the hot dog, and I can argue that I am transforming the original work, meaning I am under fair use as it is transformative work. 
	If i market the gameObject menu, I am subject to (specifically in Idaho), up to $250,000 in fines and up to 5 years in jail. I could also just be told to stop using the copyrighted material! 
	In my snapshot, it shows the implemented hot dog design.
